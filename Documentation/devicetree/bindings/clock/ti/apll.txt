Binding for Texas Instruments APLL clock.

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].  It assumes a
register-mapped APLL with usually two selectable input clocks
(reference clock and bypass clock), with analog phase locked
loop logic for multiplying the input clock to a desired output
clock. This clock also typically supports different operation
modes (locked, low power stop etc.) APLL mostly behaves like
a subtype of a DPLL [2], although a simplified one at that.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,dra7-apll-clock"
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
- clocks : link phandles of parent clocks (clk-ref and clk-bypass)
- reg : address and length of the register set for controlling the APLL.
  It contains the information of registers in the following order:
	"control" - contains the control register base address
	"idlest" - contains the idlest register base address

Examples:
	apll_pcie_ck: apll_pcie_ck@4a008200 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&apll_pcie_in_clk_mux>, <&dpll_pcie_ref_ck>;
		reg = <0x4a00821c 0x4>, <0x4a008220 0x4>;
		compatible = "ti,dra7-apll-clock";
	};
