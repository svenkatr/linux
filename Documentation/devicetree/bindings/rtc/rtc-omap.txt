TI Real Time Clock

Required properties:
- compatible:
	- "ti,da830-rtc"  - for RTC IP used similar to that on DA8xx SoC family.
	- "ti,am3352-rtc" - for RTC IP used similar to that on AM335x SoC family.
			    This RTC IP has special WAKE-EN Register to enable
			    Wakeup generation for event Alarm.
- reg: Address range of rtc register set
- interrupts: rtc timer, alarm interrupts in order
- interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt controller

Example:

rtc@1c23000 {
	compatible = "ti,da830-rtc";
	reg = <0x23000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <19
		      19>;
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
};
