TI PHY: DT DOCUMENTATION FOR PHYs in TI PLATFORMs

OMAP CONTROL PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of
 "ti,control-phy-otghs" - if it has otghs_control mailbox register as on OMAP4.
 "ti,control-phy-usb2" - if it has Power down bit in control_dev_conf register
                        e.g. USB2_PHY on OMAP5.
 "ti,control-phy-pipe3" - if it has DPLL and individual Rx & Tx power control
                        e.g. USB3 PHY and SATA PHY on OMAP5.
 "ti,control-phy-usb2-dra7" - if it has power down register like USB2 PHY on
                        DRA7 platform.
 "ti,control-phy-usb2-am437" - if it has power down register like USB2 PHY on
                        AM437 platform.
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
   the address of "otghs_control" for control-phy-otghs or "power" register
   for other types.
 - reg-names: should be "otghs_control" control-phy-otghs and "power" for
   other types.

omap_control_usb: omap-control-usb@4a002300 {
        compatible = "ti,control-phy-otghs";
        reg = <0x4a00233c 0x4>;
        reg-names = "otghs_control";
};

OMAP USB2 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,omap-usb2"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - #phy-cells: determine the number of cells that should be given in the
   phandle while referencing this phy.

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
   the PHY.

This is usually a subnode of ocp2scp to which it is connected.

usb2phy@4a0ad080 {
	compatible = "ti,omap-usb2";
	reg = <0x4a0ad080 0x58>;
	ctrl-module = <&omap_control_usb>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
};

TI PIPE3 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,phy-usb3" or "ti,phy-pipe3-sata".
   "ti,omap-usb3" is deprecated.
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - reg-names: The names of the register addresses corresponding to the registers
   filled in "reg".
 - #phy-cells: determine the number of cells that should be given in the
   phandle while referencing this phy.
 - clocks: a list of phandles and clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
   clock-names.
 - clock-names: should include:
   * "wkupclk" - wakeup clock.
   * "sysclk" - system clock.
   * "refclk" - reference clock.

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
   the PHY.

This is usually a subnode of ocp2scp to which it is connected.

usb3phy@4a084400 {
	compatible = "ti,phy-usb3";
	reg = <0x4a084400 0x80>,
	      <0x4a084800 0x64>,
	      <0x4a084c00 0x40>;
	reg-names = "phy_rx", "phy_tx", "pll_ctrl";
	ctrl-module = <&omap_control_usb>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&usb_phy_cm_clk32k>,
		 <&sys_clkin>,
		 <&usb_otg_ss_refclk960m>;
	clock-names =	"wkupclk",
			"sysclk",
			"refclk";
};
