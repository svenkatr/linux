USB Peripheral Controller driver for Aeroflex Gaisler GRUSBDC.

The GRUSBDC USB Device Controller core is available in the GRLIB VHDL
IP core library.

Note: In the ordinary environment for the core, a Leon SPARC system,
these properties are built from information in the AMBA plug&play.

Required properties:

- name : Should be "GAISLER_USBDC" or "01_021"

- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device

- interrupts : Interrupt numbers for this device

Optional properties:

- epobufsizes : An array of buffer sizes for OUT endpoints. If the property is
	not present, or for endpoints outside of the array, 1024 is assumed by
	the driver.

- epibufsizes : An array of buffer sizes for IN endpoints. If the property is
	not present, or for endpoints outside of the array, 1024 is assumed by
	the driver.
