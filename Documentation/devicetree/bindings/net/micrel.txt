Micrel PHY properties.

These properties cover the base properties Micrel PHYs.

Optional properties:

 - micrel,led-mode : LED mode value to set for PHYs with configurable LEDs.

              Configure the LED mode with single value. The list of PHYs and
	      the bits that are currently supported:

	      KSZ8001: register 0x1e, bits 15..14
	      KSZ8041: register 0x1e, bits 15..14
	      KSZ8021: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	      KSZ8031: register 0x1f, bits 5..4
	      KSZ8051: register 0x1f, bits 5..4

              See the respective PHY datasheet for the mode values.
