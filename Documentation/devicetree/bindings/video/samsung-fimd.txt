Device-Tree bindings for Samsung SoC display controller (FIMD)

FIMD (Fully Interactive Mobile Display) is the Display Controller for the
Samsung series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"samsung,s3c2443-fimd"; /* for S3C24XX SoCs */
		"samsung,s3c6400-fimd"; /* for S3C64XX SoCs */
		"samsung,s5p6440-fimd"; /* for S5P64X0 SoCs */
		"samsung,s5pc100-fimd"; /* for S5PC100 SoC  */
		"samsung,s5pv210-fimd"; /* for S5PV210 SoC */
		"samsung,exynos4210-fimd"; /* for Exynos4 SoCs */
		"samsung,exynos5250-fimd"; /* for Exynos5 SoCs */

- reg: physical base address and length of the FIMD registers set.

- interrupt-parent: should be the phandle of the fimd controller's
		parent interrupt controller.

- interrupts: should contain a list of all FIMD IP block interrupts in the
		 order: FIFO Level, VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

- interrupt-names: should contain the interrupt names: "fifo", "vsync",
	"lcd_sys", in the same order as they were listed in the interrupts
        property.

- pinctrl-0: pin control group to be used for this controller.

- pinctrl-names: must contain a "default" entry.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
         clock-names property.

- clock-names: list of clock names sorted in the same order as the clocks
               property. Must contain "sclk_fimd" and "fimd".

Optional Properties:
- samsung,power-domain: a phandle to FIMD power domain node.
- samsung,invert-vden: video enable signal is inverted
- samsung,invert-vclk: video clock signal is inverted
- display-timings: timing settings for FIMD, as described in document [1].
		Can be used in case timings cannot be provided otherwise
		or to override timings provided by the panel.

The device node can contain 'port' child nodes according to the bindings defined
in [2]. The following are properties specific to those nodes:
- reg: (required) port index, can be:
		0 - for CAMIF0 input,
		1 - for CAMIF1 input,
		2 - for CAMIF2 input,
		3 - for parallel output,
		4 - for write-back interface

Example:

SoC specific DT entry:

	fimd@11c00000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimd";
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		reg = <0x11c00000 0x20000>;
		interrupt-names = "fifo", "vsync", "lcd_sys";
		interrupts = <11 0>, <11 1>, <11 2>;
		clocks = <&clock 140>, <&clock 283>;
		clock-names = "sclk_fimd", "fimd";
		samsung,power-domain = <&pd_lcd0>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Board specific DT entry:

	fimd@11c00000 {
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcd_clk &lcd_data24 &pwm1_out>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		status = "okay";
	};
