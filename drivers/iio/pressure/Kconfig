	  Say yes here to build support for the HID SENSOR
	  Pressure driver

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called hid-sensor-press.

config MPL3115
	tristate "Freescale MPL3115A2 pressure sensor driver"
	depends on I2C
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for the Freescale MPL3115A2
	  pressure sensor / altimeter.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
          will be called mpl3115.

config IIO_ST_PRESS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics pressure sensor Driver"
	depends on (I2C || SPI_MASTER) && SYSFS
	select IIO_ST_SENSORS_CORE
	select IIO_ST_PRESS_I2C if (I2C)
	select IIO_ST_PRESS_SPI if (SPI_MASTER)
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER if (IIO_BUFFER)
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics pressure
	  sensors: LPS001WP, LPS25H, LPS331AP.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, these modules
	  will be created:
	  - st_pressure (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_pressure_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_pressure_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.
