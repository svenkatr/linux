	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information via sysfs.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

	  Note that using this driver in concert with efibootmgr requires
	  at least test release version 0.5.0-test3 or later, which is
	  available from Matt Domsch's website located at:
	  <http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test3.tar.gz>

	  Subsequent efibootmgr releases may be found at:

	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable use efivars as a backend to pstore. This

	depends on EFI_VARS_PSTORE
	default n
	help
	  Saying Y here will disable the use of efivars as a storage

	depends on X86 && EFI && KEXEC
	default y
	help
	  Export efi runtime memory maps to /sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map.
	  That memory map is used for example by kexec to set up efi virtual
	  mapping the 2nd kernel, but can also be used for debugging purposes.

	  See also Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-efi-runtime-map.
