	  This is a v4l2 driver for the TI OMAP2 camera capture interface

	  It uses the deprecated int-device API. Since this driver is no
	  longer actively maintained and nobody is interested in converting
	  it to the subdev API, this driver will be removed soon.

	  If you do want to keep this driver in the kernel, and are willing
	  to convert it to the subdev API, then please contact the linux-media
	  mailinglist.
