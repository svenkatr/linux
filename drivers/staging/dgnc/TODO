* remove kzalloc casts
* checkpatch fixes
* sparse fixes
* fix use of sizeof(). Example replace sizeof(struct board_t) 
  with sizeof(*brd) and remove sizeof(char)
* change name of board_t to dgnc_board
* split two assignments into the two assignments on two lines;
  don't use two equals signs
* remove unecessary comments
* remove unecessary error messages. Example kzalloc() has its 
  own error message. Adding an extra one is useless.
* use goto statements for error handling when appropriate
* there is a lot of unecessary code in the driver. It was 
  originally a standalone driver. Remove uneeded code.
