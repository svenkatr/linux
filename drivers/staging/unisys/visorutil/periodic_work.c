/** This function returns TRUE iff your call actually stopped the periodic

 *
 *  -- PAY ATTENTION... this is important --
 *
 *  NO NO #1
 *
 *     Do NOT call this function from some function that is running on the
 *     same workqueue as the work you are trying to stop might be running
 *     on!  If you violate this rule, visor_periodic_work_stop() MIGHT work,
 *     but it also MIGHT get hung up in an infinite loop saying
 *     "waiting for delayed work...".  This will happen if the delayed work
 *     you are trying to cancel has been put in the workqueue list, but can't
 *     run yet because we are running that same workqueue thread right now.
 *
 *     Bottom line: If you need to call visor_periodic_work_stop() from a
 *     workitem, be sure the workitem is on a DIFFERENT workqueue than the
 *     workitem that you are trying to cancel.
 *
 *     If I could figure out some way to check for this "no no" condition in
 *     the code, I would.  It would have saved me the trouble of writing this
 *     long comment.  And also, don't think this is some "theoretical" race
 *     condition.  It is REAL, as I have spent the day chasing it.
 *
 *  NO NO #2
 *
 *     Take close note of the locks that you own when you call this function.
 *     You must NOT own any locks that are needed by the periodic work
 *     function that is currently installed.  If you DO, a deadlock may result,
 *     because stopping the periodic work often involves waiting for the last
 *     iteration of the periodic work function to complete.  Again, if you hit
 *     this deadlock, you will get hung up in an infinite loop saying
 *     "waiting for delayed work...".
