 * Abstract:
 *
 * This file defines the DiagChannel protocol.  This protocol is used to aid in
 * preserving event data sent by external applications.  This protocol provides
 * a region for event data to reside in.  This data will eventually be sent to
 * the Boot Partition where it will be committed to memory and/or disk.  This
 * file contains platform-independent data that can be built using any
 * Supervisor build environment (Windows, Linux, EFI).
