	  Support for Broadcom BCM470X and BCM5301X SoCs with ARM CPU cores.

	  This is a network SoC line mostly used in home routers and
	  wifi access points, it's internal name is Northstar.
	  This inclused the following SoC: BCM53010, BCM53011, BCM53012,
	  BCM53014, BCM53015, BCM53016, BCM53017, BCM53018, BCM4707,
	  BCM4708 and BCM4709.

	  Do not confuse this with the BCM4760 which is a totally
	  different SoC or with the older BCM47XX and BCM53XX based
	  network SoC using a MIPS CPU, they are supported by arch/mips/bcm47xx
