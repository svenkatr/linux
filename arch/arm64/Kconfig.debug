config FRAME_POINTER
	bool
	default y

config STRICT_DEVMEM
	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	depends on MMU
	help
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel.

	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
	  userspace access to memory mapped peripherals.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have an early console using the
	  earlyprintk=<name>[,<addr>][,<options>] kernel parameter. It
	  is assumed that the early console device has been initialised
	  by the boot loader prior to starting the Linux kernel.

config PID_IN_CONTEXTIDR
	bool "Write the current PID to the CONTEXTIDR register"
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the kernel to write the current PID to
	  the CONTEXTIDR register, at the expense of some additional
	  instructions during context switch. Say Y here only if you are
	  planning to use hardware trace tools with this kernel.
